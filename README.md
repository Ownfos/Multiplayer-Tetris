## overview
- This project implements server and client for 2 player tetris.
- I used custom DirectX11 and WinSock2 wrapping static libraries(directx11 playground, winsock playground) which are stored under "library" folder. They are both built with debug mode so do not try building on release mode.

- Indentation of source codes looks strange on browser, but it looks all right on visual studio 2019. I should probably fix it someday...

## requirements
- Since it's made with Windows dependent libraries, you're OS should be Windows.
- Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable (or Visual Studio 2019) should be installed as I know. I heard that installing VS is the safest way to get access to all required dlls like msvcp140d.dll.
