This project implements server and client for 2 player tetris.
I used custom DirectX11 and WinSock2 wrapping library(directx11 playground, winsock playground) which are stored under "library" folder.

Indentation of source codes looks strange on browser, but it looks all right on visual studio 2019. I should probably fix it someday...
